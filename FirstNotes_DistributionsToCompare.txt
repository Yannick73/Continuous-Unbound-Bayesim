Normal

Student-t

Skew-Normal

Cauchy

CauchyAsymmetric Laplace
% For example, used in quantile regression.

Exponentially modified Gaussian (ExGaussian)
% Common for response time modeling although not strictly respective the lower bound of zero. In the field of cognitive modeling, we may find additional interesting distributions for example for response times.

Gumbel

Generalized extreme value distribution (???)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution 2 parameters (w/o location), median

Laplace
1 parameter plus location, mean and median are location?
